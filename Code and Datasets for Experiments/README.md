## This directory uses all the trained/pretrained models to simulate all the tasks that were performed by human beings and compare the results and draw inferences. Description of each task is given in the code. 

#### The folders Task_1 to Task_5 contain the stimuli provided to us or the ones we came up with in order to replicate the results of the paper. Here is a description of what they contain:

1. Task_1 contains stimuli images of upright faces, used for the task of target matching.
2. Task_2 contains stimuli that was used to compare representional similarity in CNNs and Humans.
3. Task_4_inverted contains images of stimuli used to test the inverted face effect. It contains images of faces rotated by 180 from task_1.
4. Task_4_inverted contains images of stimuli used to test the other race effect. It contains two directories, one with face stimuli of asian faces, one with aces of poeple of white race.
5. Task_5 Contains two directories. One has stimuli of cars and the other is the same stimul, but rotated by 180 degrees to show that there is no speciality in the 'face' stimuli, it is the optimisation that results in the inverted face effect. 

The stimuli used for running these tasks are uploaded here:
