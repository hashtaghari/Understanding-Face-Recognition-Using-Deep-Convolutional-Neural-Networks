# Understanding-Face-Recognition-Using-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Replication and Extension of the Research Paper: 'Dobs, Katharina &amp; Yuan, Joanne &amp; Martinez, Julio &amp; Kanwisher, Nancy. (2022). Using deep convolutional neural networks to test why human face recognition works the way it does. 10.1101/2022.11.23.517478. '


The folder 'Code and Datasets for Experiments' contains the code and the stimuli used to replicate the results of the paper, we tried to replicate the inferences in case the exact stimuli weren't availiable.
