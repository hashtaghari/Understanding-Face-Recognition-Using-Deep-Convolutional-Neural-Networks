This folder contains the code and dataset we used to train the CNNs.

The models we trained were for:

1. CNN trained for face recognition, when inverted face images were provided.
2. CNN trained for object categorisation, where face is one of the categories. 
3. CNN trained for Face recognition, only trained on Asian faces.
4. CNN trained for Face recognition, only traiend on White faces. 

Here are the links to datasets used for training these CNNs.

### Modified Datasets:
- CASIA-webface dataset was used for the other race effect. 
  - Dataset contains multiples faces for each identity.  
  - White faces are extracted from this dataset by running a script based on the metadata provided.
