This folder contains the CNN models we trained, when pre trained models were not availiable.

The models we trained were for:

1. CNN trained for face recognition, which has only seen inverted faces.
2. CNN trained for face recognition with upright images on the same dataset as above, to compare and contrast performances.
3. CNN trained for Face recognition, only trained on Asian faces.
4. CNN trained for Face recognition, only traiend on White faces.
5. CNN trained to recognise cars, i.e. classify a car based on its model.  
6. CNN trained for object categorisation, where face is one of the categories
